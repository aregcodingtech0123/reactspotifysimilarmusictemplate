# reactspotifysimilarmusictemplate
This project provides a collection of UI templates for both authenticated and unauthenticated users, built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.

Each project folders includes a 'screenshots' directory, which is located in folder public, containing visual captures of the website, showcasing both authenticated and unauthenticated user experiences.

Due to this was my first professional frontend development and which has not done yet, there are some little issues about the appearance and missing parts. However, these issues will be rectified over time. I apologize for missing and incorrect parts for now.

To display logged users version, enter any random name just after url "http://localhost:PORT/, where PORT represents a port number. For instance, "http://localhost:5174/Joe/" will display a template for a logged user named "Joe".

To display non logged user version, just url "http://localhost:PORT/", where PORT represents a port number, can display a non logged user template.

**Components for both authenticated and unauthenticated users are organized within dedicated folders: `forloggedusers` and `fornonloggedusers`, respectively.**
